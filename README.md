## **Introduction**

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for Databel, a fictitious telecom company. Understanding and reducing customer churn is a major priority for subscription-based businesses, as it directly impacts long-term profitability and growth.

In this analysis, I worked with a dataset containing customer details, subscription plans, usage data, and churn status. The goal was to determine the churn rate, explore the reasons behind customer churn, and analyze key factors that might be influencing it.

Through various Excel techniques, including calculated fields, PivotTables, and data visualizations, I created a comprehensive overview of customer churn trends and potential areas for improvement.

## **Methodology**

The analysis followed these steps:

### **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:

- Cleaned and preprocessed the raw dataset, ensuring that all columns and values were properly formatted.

- Checked for missing data and inconsistencies, removing or correcting any errors.

### **Calculated Metrics**:

#### **Total Number of Customers**: 

Calculated the total customer count.

#### **Churn Rate (%)**: 

Calculated the percentage of customers who churned relative to the total number of customers.

#### **Churned Customers**: 

Identified and quantified the number of customers who left the service.

#### **Visualizations Created**: 

I built the following key visualizations to analyze the churn data:

#### **Churn Reasons Bar Chart**: 

A bar chart showing the different reasons for churn, with corresponding churn rates for each reason.

#### **Churn Rate by Demographics**: 

A bar chart breaking down churn rates by customer demographics, including groups such as:

 - Under 30
- Seniors
- Other age groups

#### **Competitor Analysis Churn Rate**: 

A pie chart displaying the churn rate percentage across different competitors, with reasons for churn associated with each competitor.

#### **Age Group Churn Analysis**: 

A detailed analysis of the number of customers churning within different age groups.

#### **Internet GB Consumption and Plan Type Analysis**: 

A combination of bar charts showing churn rate percentages across different internet usage groups (e.g., 10+ GB, 6â€“10 GB, less than 5 GB) with additional breakdowns based on whether customers have an international plan or not.

#### **Dashboard Creation**:

I consolidated these visualizations into a dynamic Excel dashboard to allow for easy exploration and presentation of churn-related insights.

## **Results**

#### **The analysis revealed several important insights**:

#### **Churn Reasons**:

The main reasons for customer churn were related to pricing, customer service issues, and competition from other telecom providers.
The churn rate for each reason was visualized in a bar chart, showing which issues had the greatest impact on retention.

#### **Demographic Churn**:

Customers under 30 had a higher churn rate compared to other demographic groups, while seniors exhibited a lower churn rate.
This demographic breakdown was visualized in a bar chart, allowing for clear comparisons between groups.

#### **Competitor Analysis**:

A pie chart showed the churn rate percentages for customers who switched to different telecom competitors.
Reasons for churn varied across competitors, but service reliability and pricing were consistent drivers of switching.

#### **Age Group Churn**:

Churn was significantly higher among customers aged 18-30, with the numbers tapering off as age increased.
This insight could help target retention strategies more effectively, especially for younger demographics.
Internet Usage and Plan Type:

Customers who consumed more than 10 GB of data had a lower churn rate than those with lower consumption.
Churn rates were also broken down by whether customers had an international plan or not, showing that those without international plans had a higher likelihood of churning, especially in the higher GB consumption groups.

## **Conclusion**

This analysis provides valuable insights into customer churn patterns and highlights several key areas that Databel can focus on to improve customer retention:

- Targeting younger customers (under 30) with special offers or better service plans could help reduce churn in this group.
- Improving customer service and addressing common reasons for churn (e.g., pricing concerns) could significantly lower churn rates.
- Focusing on high-usage customers (those consuming 10+ GB) by providing them with more tailored plans or incentives could help retain this high-value customer segment.
- International plan offerings: Offering more appealing international plans might help reduce churn among customers who are likely to switch for better global coverage.
- The interactive dashboard and visualizations created using Excel provide clear, actionable insights for decision-makers to reduce churn and increase customer retention.
